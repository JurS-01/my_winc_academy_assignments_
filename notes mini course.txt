Semantic HTML						geeft betekenis aan de verschillende html elementen

<article>						are essentially mini web pages in your HTML document. They have their own headers, footers, and document outline that are 
							completely isolated from the rest of your site. It should only wrap content that can be plucked out of your page and distributed 
							in a completely different context. For instance, an app like Flipboard should be able to grab an <article> element from your site, 
							display it in its own app, and have it make perfect sense to its readers.

<section>						sort of like an <article>, except it doesn’t need to make sense outside the context of the document. That is, an app like Flipboard 
							wouldn’t try to pull out all the <section>’s of your page and present them as independent pieces of content.
							note that each <section> element should contain at least one heading, otherwise it will add an “untitled section” to your document 
							outline.
							Our advice is to only use <section> as a more descriptive <div> wrapper for the implicitly defined sections of your page. Don’t use 
							it for self-contained content (that’s what <article> is for) or when it’s purely for layout purposes.
Header+footer						only associated with the nearest sectioning element—typically a <body>, <section>, or <article> element. This means that you can use 
							multiple <header> elements to add introductory content to different parts of a document. For instance, the title, author, and 
							publication date of our <article> is a pretty good candidate for another <header>
<address> 						element is like <time> in that it doesn’t deal with the overall structure of a document, but rather embellishes the parent <article> 
							or <body> element with some metadata. It defines contact information for the author of the article or web page in question. 
							<address> should not be used for arbitrary physical addresses.

WIREFRAMING - BALSAMIQ

The Software Process
1. Identify problem (Product Manager )
2. Design solution (Designer)
3. Build it (Developer)

How GOOD software gets made
1. Identify problem (Product Manager )
2. Understand problem (whole team, problem and agree) UX
3. Design solution (Designer and UX) 
4. Plan and communicate solution (UX)
5. Build it (Developer)


UX designer bridge gap between idea and code
Wireframes are both design and communication tool

PRototypes are a realistic representation of product, often used for testing, come later in process then wireframe, final checkpoint before developing

diffrence wireframe prototpes
Wireframe
- for communication and ideation
- fast / 'cheap'
- rough

prototype
- presentation, selling
- time-consuming, 'espensive'
- polished

input field ook altijd een name meegeven, belangrijk voor JS

----------------
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 1fr));  		one area never smaller then 100px, but columns always auto-fit full-width of screen

grid-auto-rows: 100px;		when screen-width changes you get different amount of rows. this makes sure the height is always 100px.


grid-auto-flow: dense;		auto fulls up empty spaces with screen-with change, by changing the order of areas. changes order in html lay out
